**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **100% Complete**

## What We Built

The Smart Snooze System helps you manage follow-ups more effectively by automatically suggesting the best times to be reminded, while always respecting your preferences and schedule.

---

## Key Features

### ✅ Smart Suggestions
- The system learns from your behavior and suggests the best follow-up times
- Shows 3-5 time options when you snooze a reminder
- Highlights the best option with a "Recommended" badge
- Gets smarter over time as you use it

### ✅ Your Preferences Control Everything
- **Working Hours:** Set when you're available (e.g., Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5:30 PM)
- **Quiet Hours:** Block reminders during lunch, meetings, or focus time
- **Weekend Rules:** Choose whether to allow weekend reminders or defer to weekdays
- **Daily Limits:** Set maximum reminders per day to avoid overload
- **Cooldown Period:** Prevent reminders for the same contact too frequently (default: 30 minutes)

### ✅ Category Settings
- Different settings for different reminder types:
  - **Follow-ups:** Reminders for contacts
  - **Affirmations:** Motivational reminders
  - **Generic:** Other reminders
- Each category can have its own intensity (low, medium, high) and default duration

### ✅ Conflict Resolution
- When multiple reminders are due at the same time, they're automatically bundled together
- You receive one combined reminder instead of multiple notifications
- Choose how bundles are formatted: detailed list, summary, or combined message

### ✅ Do Not Disturb (DND)
- Block all reminders when you need focus time
- Emergency contacts can bypass DND
- Keywords in reminder messages can also bypass DND
- Separate from quiet hours for more control
