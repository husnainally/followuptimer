# FollowUpTimer – User-Facing Quick Guide

## Quick Start: Create Your First Follow-Up
- Go to Dashboard → **Create Reminder**
- Add title/notes, pick date & time; we schedule it exactly there
- Link a contact if you want the reminder tied to a person
- Save; you'll get notified at the scheduled time

## Snooze + Quiet Hours
- Snooze options: later today, tomorrow AM, next working day, in 3 days, next week, or pick a time
- Suggestions respect working hours, optional quiet hours (even if they span midnight), timezone, and weekend toggle
- Quiet hours suppress notifications; we move the reminder to the next allowed slot

## Contacts + Linked Reminders
- Contacts group reminders by person and keep a simple timeline
- Link a reminder to a contact when creating/editing; timelines show completed, snoozed, and upcoming follow-ups

## Weekly Digest
- Default: sent Monday 8:00 AM (user timezone); customizable in Settings
- Includes reminders completed, snoozed count, consistency score, and tips
- Digest only sends if you had activity that week; toggle on/off anytime
