# Email and Push Notification Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Email Error Handling (`lib/email.ts`)  
- ✅ Added comprehensive error logging
- ✅ Checks for `RESEND_API_KEY` configuration
- ✅ Logs email send attempts and results
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Push Notification Logging (`lib/push-notification.ts`)
- ✅ Added detailed logging for subscription fetching
- ✅ Logs each push notification attempt
- ✅ Better error messages with subscription details
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of invalid subscriptions

### 3. Improved Webhook Logging (`app/api/reminders/send/route.ts`)
- ✅ Logs user notification preferences
- ✅ Better error tracking for each notification type

### 4. New Test Endpoint (`app/api/notifications/test/route.ts`)
- ✅ Test email notifications independently
- ✅ Test push notifications independently
- ✅ Test both together
- ✅ Returns configuration status

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Test Notifications

**In Browser Console (while logged in):**
```javascript
fetch('/api/notifications/test', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ type: 'both' })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('Config:', data.config);
  console.log('Results:', data.results);
});
```

### Step 2: Check Vercel Logs

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions
2. Look for logs with these prefixes:
   - `[Email]` - Email sending attempts
   - `[Push]` - Push notification attempts
   - `[Webhook]` - Reminder webhook processing

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

**Required for Email:**
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Must be set in Vercel
- `RESEND_FROM` - Must be a verified domain in Resend

**Required for Push:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` - Must be set in Vercel
- `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` - Must be set in Vercel
- `VAPID_EMAIL` - Optional (defaults to `mailto:noreply@followuptimer.app`)

### Step 4: Check User Settings

1. **Email Notifications:**
   - User must have `email_notifications = true` in `profiles` table
   - User must have an email address in their profile

2. **Push Notifications:**
   - User must have `push_notifications = true` in `profiles` table
   - User must have enabled push in Settings → Notifications
   - Browser must have granted notification permission
   - Subscription must exist in `push_subscriptions` table

## Current Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Email - Domain Not Verified

**Error:** `"The followuptimer.app domain is not verified"`

**Root Cause:** Resend doesn't allow free public domains like `followuptimer.vercel.app`. You need to use a **custom domain you own**.

**Solution:**
1. **Buy or use an existing domain** (e.g., `followuptimer.com`)
2. **Add domain in Resend:**
   - Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter your domain (not `.vercel.app`)
   - Add DNS records provided by Resend
   - Wait for verification (5-10 minutes)
3. **Update Vercel environment variable:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Set `RESEND_FROM` to: `FollowUpTimer <noreply@yourdomain.com>`
   - Make sure it's set for **Production** environment
   - Redeploy application

📖 **Detailed Guide:** See `docs/resend-domain-setup.md`

### Issue 2: Push - No Subscriptions Found

**Error:** `"No push subscriptions found. Please enable push notifications in settings."`

**Root Cause:** User hasn't enabled push notifications in the app settings yet.

**Solution:**
1. **Login to your app:** https://followuptimer.vercel.app/login
2. **Go to Settings → Notifications**
3. **Toggle "Browser Push Notifications" to ON**
4. **Grant permission** when browser prompts
5. **Test again** using `/api/notifications/test`

📖 **Detailed Guide:** See `docs/push-notification-setup.md`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Email Not Working

**Issue:** No emails received

**Check:**
1. ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
2. ✅ `RESEND_FROM` domain is verified in Resend dashboard (must be your own domain, not `.vercel.app`)
3. ✅ User has `email_notifications = true` in profile
4. ✅ User has email address in profile
5. ✅ Check Vercel logs for `[Email]` errors
6. ✅ Check Resend dashboard for sent emails

**Solution:**
- Use your own domain (not free public domains)
- Verify domain in Resend dashboard
- Ensure environment variables are set for Production
- Redeploy after updating environment variables

### Push Not Working

**Issue:** No push notifications received

**Check:**
1. ✅ VAPID keys are configured in Vercel
2. ✅ User has `push_notifications = true` in profile
3. ✅ User has enabled push in Settings
4. ✅ Browser has granted notification permission
5. ✅ Subscription exists in `push_subscriptions` table
6. ✅ Service worker is registered (`/sw.js` accessible)
7. ✅ Check Vercel logs for `[Push]` errors

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings → Notifications
2. Toggle "Browser Push Notifications" OFF then ON
3. Grant permission when browser prompts
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify subscription in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM push_subscriptions WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
   ```
